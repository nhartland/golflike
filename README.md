**golflike** is an attempt at making a coffee-break golf-themed roguelike. It
features a randomly generated 9-hole course, with three different environment
themes. Games are very short, mostly taking less than ten minutes.

Terminal installation
---------------------

In addition to the applications above **golflike** can be played in your terminal. The easiest way to set it up is through [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/):
```shell
luarocks install golflike
```
**Note:** **golflike** uses the font and default 16-colour palette of your terminal. If your colourscheme is not a good match then the game might look very strange indeed!
