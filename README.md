**golflike** is an attempt at making a coffee-break golf-themed roguelike. It
features a randomly generated 9-hole course, with three different environment
themes. Games are very short, mostly taking less than ten minutes.


**Very much a WIP**

Getting the game
----------------

**golflike** can be played either in a terminal or as a Löve application.
Note the terminal version uses the standard 16-colour palette of your terminal.

Terminal **golflike** can be obtained via LuaRocks:

```Shell
    luarocks install golflike
```

Löve **golflike** can be downloaded from the releases page.
