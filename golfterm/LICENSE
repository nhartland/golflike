Although heavily modified, the pure lua driver (plua_driver) is
based on code from `plterm` from Phil Leblanc.

Likewise, the love driver (love_driver) is a heavily modified version
of the ASCII display panel of ROT.LOVE by Paul Lewis. The cp437 glyphs
also come from ROT.LOVE.

Below are the license notices for my work, and the original works 
by Phil Leblanc and Paul Lewis.
